---

A C++ SFML Simple Snake game with custom game engine [Snake](https://github.com/abdimk/Snake) script runtime.

Write and run scripts, similar to runtimes for other languages such as [Node](https://nodejs.org) / [Deno](https://deno.land), or [Luvit](https://luvit.io) for vanilla Lua.

Lune provides fully asynchronous APIs wherever possible, and is built in Rust 🦀 for optimal safety and correctness.

## Features

-   🌙 A strictly minimal but powerful interface that is easy to read and remember, just like Luau itself
-   🧰 Fully featured APIs for the filesystem, networking, stdio, all included in the small (~3mb) executable
-   📚 World-class documentation, on the web _or_ directly in your editor, no network connection necessary
-   🏡 A familiar scripting environment for Roblox developers, with an included 1-to-1 task scheduler port
-   ✏️ Optional built-in library for manipulating Roblox place & model files, and their instances

## Non-goals

-   Making scripts short and terse - proper autocomplete / intellisense make scripting using Lune just as quick, and readability is important
-   Running full Roblox game scripts outside of Roblox - there is some compatibility, but Lune is meant for different purposes

## Where do I start?

Head over to the [installation](https://lune.gitbook.io/lune/home/installation) page to get started using Lune!
